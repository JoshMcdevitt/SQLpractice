*/ returns pervious champions of each years event by gender
by partiioning each gender with partition by and using lag to display each previous country

  WHERE
    Year >= 2000 AND
    Event = 'Javelin Throw' AND

*/ doing something similar as the last practice but instead 
partitioning by gender and event so it is more oganized /*
